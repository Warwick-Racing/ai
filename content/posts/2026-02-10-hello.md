## What This Document Is For

This post is both an example and a reusable template.  
Copy it, update a few fields, commit to `main`, and the build will generate a new blog page automatically.

---

## 1. Where to Put Files

Project repo: [https://github.com/Warwick-Racing/ai/](https://github.com/Warwick-Racing/ai/)

Put all new posts in:

`content/posts/`

---

## 2. How to Name Files (Defines the URL)

Recommended format:

`YYYY-MM-DD-your-slug.md`

Examples:

- `2026-02-10-why-ai-agents.md`
- `2026-02-11-team-weekly-update.md`

Generated page paths:

- `/blog/2026-02-10-why-ai-agents`
- `/blog/2026-02-11-team-weekly-update`

Naming tips:

- Use lowercase letters, numbers, and `-` only
- Avoid spaces, non-ASCII file names, and special symbols
- Keep slugs short and clear; avoid renaming later (renaming changes the URL)

---

## 3. Required Frontmatter Fields

Each post must start with this block (wrapped by `---`):

```md
---
title: "Post title"
date: "2026-02-10"
author: "Sibo"
tags: ["ai", "team", "update"]
summary: "One-line summary. Recommended length: 30-80 words."
---
```

Field meanings:

- `title`: Display title on the post page
- `date`: Publish date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- `author`: Author name
- `tags`: Tag array used in blog list filters
- `summary`: Short description shown on the blog list

---

date: "2026-02-10"

## 5. How to Publish (Team Workflow)

1. Open `content/posts/` on the `main` branch in GitHub
2. Click `Add file` -> `Create new file` (or `Upload files`)
3. Use a valid filename, for example `2026-02-12-new-sensor-pipeline.md`
4. Paste the template and edit the content
5. Commit to `main`
6. GitHub Action builds and publishes to the `blog` branch automatically
7. Visit `/blog` for the list, then open `/blog/<slug>` for the post page

## 6. FAQ

### 1) Why is my post not showing up?

Check:

- Is the file inside `content/posts/`?
- Is the extension `.md`?
- Does frontmatter include `title/date/author/tags/summary`?
- Is `date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format?
- Did the workflow run and pass successfully?

### 2) Can I skip `summary`?

You can, but writing it is recommended.  
If missing, the system auto-generates one from the body, which is usually less readable.

### 3) Can I use code blocks and links?

Yes. Standard Markdown syntax is supported.
